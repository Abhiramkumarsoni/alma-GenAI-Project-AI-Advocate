    Python is a high-level programming language for web development and data science.
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn.
    Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers for complex pattern recognition.
    Data science combines statistics, programming, and domain knowledge for insights.
    Natural language processing helps computers understand and generate human language.
     Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
    It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.
    
    Python is widely used in various fields:
    1. Web Development - Django, Flask frameworks
    2. Data Science - Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
    3. Machine Learning - TensorFlow, PyTorch
    4. Automation - Scripts and tools
    5. Scientific Computing - Research and analysis
    
    The language emphasizes code readability and allows developers to express concepts
    in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
    
    Python's philosophy is embedded in the document called "The Zen of Python".
    Some key principles include:
    - Beautiful is better than ugly
    - Explicit is better than implicit
    - Simple is better than complex
    - Readability counts
    
    Python has a comprehensive standard library, often described as "batteries included".
    This means developers can find modules for most tasks without external dependencies.
